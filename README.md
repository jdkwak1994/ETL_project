# ETL-project

## Proposal
How different is the living cost in major cities around the world compared to NYC?
We want to find out by gathering and extracting data from different sources that shows a comparison between NYC and other cities.
We are aiming to look for data that shows values of living, rent, cost of items, crime rate, etc. that can be compared with numerical values.

At the end, we will put the data found into a single data set and upload it to another database source, such as postgreSQL.
